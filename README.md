* Follow the nexts steps;
* and ready!

### How to manually install

** Now define database configuration, follow this:**

* DB_NAME - Your database name (Ex: littleMVC or anyway)
* DB_USER - Your user used to access database (Ex: root or anyway)
* DB_PASS - Your password used to access database

## Create a new Page
To create a new page in a MVC, you need three things, two of them being mandatory:
* M = Model
* V = View (required)
* C = Controller (required)

Our MVC uses a simple and well laid structure to use and create. Then see how to create the ** Controller **
Start by using the name of your page, and that's important.
If your page will be called ```test```, so your controller should be named ```TestController```, see the exemple below:
```php
class TestController extends Controller {
  
}
```

Great! Inside, you'll need an action, then even if it is index, then:
```php
class TestController extends Controller {
  
  /**
   * Default action.
   */
  public function indexAction() {
  
  }
}
```

Now to render your page, follow this function to make content:

```php
class TestController extends Controller {
  
  /**
   * Default action.
   */
  public function indexAction() {
    
    // Taking the file in "ROOT/system/views/home/index.phtml"
    $content = $this->view->factory('home/index');
    
    $data = array(
      // Page Meta Title
      '_title' => 'LittleMVC', 
      // Page Meta Description
      '_description' => 'Welcome! This is a little MVC.',
      // Content created in Facroey function (required)
      '_content' => $content, 
    );
    
    // Content data to render
    $this->view->render($data);
  }
}
```

## Create a new Model
As with the controller, you need to create the file with the Model name, example: ```TestModel```
```php
class TestModel {

}
```

Inside then, you can call connection with database, see:
```php
class TestModel {

  protected $db;
  
  public function _contruct(){
    
    $this->db = new Database();
  }
}
```

That done, you can now make your own calls.

```php
class TestModel {

  protected $db;
  
  public function _contruct(){
    
    $this->db = new Database();
  }
  
  public function myFunction($user_id){
    
    $var = 10;
    
    $this->db->query("SELECT * FROM `users` WHERE `uid` = '{$user_id}'");
    
    return 'test';
  }
}
```

In your view.phtml you call ```$_model->myFunction($user_id);```
